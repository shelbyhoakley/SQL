# I used a database called ‘Chinook’ that contained records from a digital media store to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL.

#1. Names of all customers from Denmark
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = ‘Denmark’;

#2. Full name, title, and country of all sales department employees
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title, Country
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales%';

#3. Invoices and their associated employee
SELECT empl.LastName, empl.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees AS empl
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON cust.SupportRepID = empl.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#4. Number of invoices in 2013
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN ‘2013-01-01’ AND ‘2013-12-31’;

#5. Total sales in 2013
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN ‘2013-01-01’ AND ‘2013-12-31’;

#6. Invoice IDs from 2013
SELECT InvoiceID
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';

#7. Highest Performer in sales from 2011
SELECT empl.FirstName, empl.LastName,
ROUND (SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS ‘Total Sales’
FROM chinook.employees AS empl
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = empl.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID
WHERE empl.Title LIKE ‘%Sales%’
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE ‘%2011%’
GROUP BY empl.FirstName
ORDER BY (Round(SUM(inv.Total), 2)) desc LIMIT 1;
